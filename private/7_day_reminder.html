<p>This email is just a reminder that you have signed up for a Thought Lounge Session on {{day}}, {{date}} at {{time}} at the following location: </p>
<br>
<p>{{location}}</p>
<p>{{address}}</p>
<br>
<p>Good thinking always, and for the love of loungin’ please don’t reply to this email! You won’t get any response,</p>
<br>
<p>Lounge Bot</p>
<br>
<p>p.s. if you have to cancel, please do it sooner rather than later, because #1 you’re holding the spot from someone else and #2 TL Sessions are small group things, so it takes everyone showing up to make it work! You can do this by looking at your “Upcoming Lounges” in your account on the site.</p>
